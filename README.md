The service boilerplate I don't want to write again.

# Usage

Create your project folder and cd into it, then running the following command
to bootstrap your service.

```sh
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zapling/go-service/main/setup.sh)
./rename-module.sh github.com/zapling/some-new-module
```
